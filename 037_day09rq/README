This is your next "reading quiz."  As with other reading quizzes,
you should read the following Jupyter notebooks:
  - "20-ClassesAndObjects" 

Make sure you understand the material in it (which may require 
re-reading all or part of it,asking questions, etc), BEFORE attempting 
this quiz.  This quiz will check your basic understanding of the 
material before you move on to other, more in-depth exercises.

As always, place your answers in "answers.txt" (one per line), and
submit as usual.
