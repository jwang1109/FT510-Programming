1. Create a file "answer.txt".
2. Execute the following code by hand as demonstrated with
   the memory/trace diagrams in class.  
   Write the output in your "answer.txt" file
3. Submit your answer.txt file for grading

def anotherFunction(a, b):
  answer = 42
  x = 0
  print(f"In anotherFunction({a},{b})")
  while (b > a):
    print("a is {}, b is {}".format(a,b))
    answer = answer + (b - a)
    b -= x
    a += x // 2
    x+=1

  return answer

def someFunction(x, y):
  a = x + y
  if (x < y):
    for i in range(x):
      print("In the loop with i = {}, a = {}".format(i,a));
      a = a + x
  else:
    y = anotherFunction(y,a+4)
  return a * y


x = 2
a = someFunction(x,3)
print("a =", a)
print("x =", x)
b = someFunction(3,x)
print("b =", b)
print("x =", x)
