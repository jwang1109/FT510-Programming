# FT510-Programming at Duke University

This repository showcases my work and dedication to the FT510 programming course during my first semester at Duke University. I am proud to have achieved an A+ in this course.

Through this course, I honed my programming skills in Python, C, and C++. One of the highlights is `121_eff_frontier`, which was the most complex assignment, which calculates efficient frontier of a portfolio you input.

## Warning to Current Students:

If you are a student currently enrolled in the FT510 programming course, **please refrain from viewing or copying any of the solutions within this repository**. Doing so might lead to violations of academic integrity. Always strive to complete your assignments on your own and seek guidance from your instructor if needed.
