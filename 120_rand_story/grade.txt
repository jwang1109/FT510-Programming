Thank you for submitting random story!
You have a Makefile--great!
Trying to run 'make rand_story'
g++ -o rand_story -std=c++11 -Wall -Werror -ggdb3 main.cpp
make succeeded--great!
make produced rand_story---great!
Trying to the testcase in the README to sanity check your output...
  - Valgrind reported errors
Either you had valgrind errors, or went into an infinite loop...

Compiling rand_story
make: 'rand_story' is up to date.
